    "`Description`\n",
    "\n",
    "NER stands for Named Entity Recognition. It is a subtask of Natural Language Processing (NLP) that involves identifying and extracting named entities from unstructured text. Named entities are specific pieces of information that are mentioned in the text and refer to real-world objects such as people, places, organizations, and dates.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of NER is to automatically identify and classify these named entities in a given text. This can be useful in many applications, such as information extraction, question answering, and sentiment analysis. NER systems typically use machine learning algorithms, such as Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), to automatically identify and label named entities in text.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we collect all the training data, prepare it for a NER model and train the model. The final output of this notebook would be a trained custom NER model that would extract Course Name related entities such as abbreviation, full-name etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Example`\n",
    "\n",
    "Input Q: \"*Im looking for all the items similar to applied data sci, are there any?*\"\n",
    "\n",
    "NER Model Output: \"applied data sci\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This output would be used to search for a matching index in ElasticSearch DB, and would return a UUID mapped to \"Applied Data Science\" course.\n",
